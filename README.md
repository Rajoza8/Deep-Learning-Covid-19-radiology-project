Diagnosing COVID-19 with Deep Learning

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a significant global healthcare challenge, necessitating swift and accurate diagnosis to mitigate its spread. Chest X-ray and CT scan images have emerged as valuable diagnostic tools for COVID-19 due to their accessibility and ability to detect characteristic lung abnormalities. Our project is a comparative analysis of multiple neural network architectures for diagnosing COVID-19 using radiographic images.
